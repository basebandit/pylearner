>Beautiful is better than ugly.
>Explicit is better than implicit.
>Simple is better than complex.
>Complex is better than complicated.
>Flat is better than nested.
>Sparse is better than dense.
>Readability counts.
>Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
>Although practicality beats purity.
>Errors should never pass silently.
>Unless explicitly silenced.
>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
>There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
>Now is better than never.
>Although never is often better than right now.
>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
>Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!
