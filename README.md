<cite>The Zen Of Python – Tim PetersM</cite>
>Beautiful is better than ugly. <br/>
>Explicit is better than implicit. <br/>
>Simple is better than complex. <br/>
>Complex is better than complicated. <br/>
>Flat is better than nested.<br/>
>Sparse is better than dense. <br/>
>Readability counts. <br/>
>Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules. <br/>
>Although practicality beats purity. <br/>
>Errors should never pass silently. <br/>
>Unless explicitly silenced.<br/>
>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <br/>
>There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it. <br/>
>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch. <br/>
>Now is better than never. <br/>
>Although never is often better than right now. <br/>
>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea. <br/>
>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <br/>
>Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those! <br/>
